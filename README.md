# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Everyone! My name is Peashooter101!

I am a student currently studying for a Bachelor's of Computer Science. I like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) far too much and you will catch me on a few other video games like [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/). While video games are clearly a huge interest in my life, I actually want to find my way into Software Engineering or Cyber Security.

I used to work in the US Air Force as a Hydrualics Systems Maintenance Technician for the [KC-135 Stratotanker](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1529736/kc-135-stratotanker/). Y'know, the flying gas stations in the sky!

> Minecraft got me into the world of Computer Science, so special thanks to Daniel Ratcliffe and his mod [ComputerCraft](https://www.computercraft.info/) for sparking an interest that changed my life back in 2012.

## Stuff I Have Worked On

### School Work

If you are looking for my school work, look no further than this little spoiler tag. This is not everything I did but should show some examples of the stuff I did. Some of these are private for school related reasons.

<details>
  <summary>Some of my school projects.</summary>
  
  | Class | Assignment | Language(s) | Summary |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Senior Project (Capstone) | [MEMS](https://github.com/Peashooter101/CSULB_CECS-491_MEMS) | C#, .NET, MongoDB | Senior Project Capstone project for Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. A C# Desktop Application for tracking and maintaining information and maintenance discreptancies and actions located within an organization or company. This software is developed and maintained for a specific company and follows some business constraints of the organization. |
  | Algorithms | [Programming Assignments 1-5](https://github.com/Peashooter101/CSULB_CECS-328) | Java | Each of the assignments is described in the provided repository, focusing on different techniques such as Recursion, Divide and Conquer, and Dynamic Programming.
  | Databases | [Key Hook Project](https://github.com/Maxi-Garcia/CECS_323_Semester_Project) | Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB | Following a provided set of business requirements, create an `ERD` to model the structure and associations of a Key Hook Management Database. Implement an application that utilizes the `PostgreSQL` database with `SQLAlchemy`, then reimplement the same application but utilizing the `MongoDB` database with `PyMongo`.
  | Principles of Programming Languages | [CECS 342 Assignments](https://github.com/Peashooter101/CSULB_CECS-342) | C, C++, C#, Haskell, Prolog, Python | Each of the assignments is described in the provided repository, focusing on how each language differs in performing similar tasks such as Sorting, Functional Programming, and Generic Programming. |
  | Object Oriented Application Development | [Pokemon Project](https://github.com/Peashooter101/CSULB_CECS-277_Pokemon_Project) | Java | Following a provided Class Diagram, develop an application that takes advantage of various Design Patterns and Collections within `Java`. |
  | Introduction to Software Engineering | [TERA](https://github.com/Peashooter101/CSULB_CECS-343_TERA) | Java, JSON | Following a provided set of business requirements, plan out and develop an application for managing tenants, expenses, rent, and annual reports for a rental property. The project takes advantage of `Maven` and the `Jackson API` for `JSON` Serialization.
  | Introduction to Cyber Security | [Malware Hacking](https://github.com/Giacalone-CECS/cecs-478-sp23-01-lab--malware-sst-Peashooter101) | Machine Code | Using a Hex Editor, find the hidden password and bypass the password check in the provided binary file for the game Super Star Trek. This assignment required using a `Hex Editor` to read and edit the binary file. Bypassing the binary file is accomplished through changing the `machine code` instructions.
  | Introduction to Cyber Security | [Arbitrary Code Execution](https://github.com/Giacalone-CECS/cecs-478-sp23-04-lab--buffer-overflow-Peashooter101) | Assembly, Machine Code | Provided with a program that has a buffer overflow vulnerabilty, cause the program to launch a separate terminal. This assignment required using `gdb` to debug and examine assembly code and a `Hex Editor` to create a file containing binary instructions to be fed into the program. This assignment is based on [Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html).
  | Introduction to Operating Systems | [Semaphores Dungeon](https://github.com/Giacalone-CECS/lab-assignment-2-semaphores-Peashooter101) | C | Provided with an object file representing a dungeon, develop 4 programs, the game driver and 3 character threads, to explore the dungeon. The game driver will spawn the 3 character threads. These character threads must receive signals from the object file to perform their respective actions and at the end, use semaphores to lock out a section of memory.

## GitHub's "Ideas To Get You Started"

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal Discord bot using the [Java Discord API](https://jda.wiki/), a Minecraft Server (play.creators-smp.com), and random Minecraft Plugins as a part of [Simplexity Development](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development). I will sometimes Pull Request random things to other Open Source Software that I use.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CyberSecurity on IBM SkillsBuild and the Forge and Fabric Minecraft Modding APIs on my free time!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a Minecraft Server owned and developed by my friend [Rhythmic](https://github.com/RhythmicSys) and I!

âš¡ Fun fact: *The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.*

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Everyone! My name is Peashooter101!

I am a student currently studying for a Bachelor's of Computer Science. I like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) far too much and you will catch me on a few other video games like [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/). While video games are clearly a huge interest in my life, I actually want to find my way into Software Engineering or Cyber Security.

I used to work in the US Air Force as a Hydrualics Systems Maintenance Technician for the [KC-135 Stratotanker](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1529736/kc-135-stratotanker/). Y'know, the flying gas stations in the sky!

> Minecraft got me into the world of Computer Science, so special thanks to Daniel Ratcliffe and his mod [ComputerCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ComputerCraft) for sparking an interest that changed my life back in 2012.

## GitHub's "Ideas To Get You Started"

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal Discord bot using the [Java Discord API](https://jda.wiki/), a Minecraft Server (play.creators-smp.com), and random Minecraft Plugins as a part of [ADHDMC](https://github.com/ADHDMC).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unsupervised Machine Learning and AutoEncoders in an Internship!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a Minecraft Server owned and developed by my friend [Rhythmic](https://github.com/RhythmicSys) and I!

âš¡ Fun fact: *The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.*
